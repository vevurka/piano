excerpt: Practice performance - 22.11.2014

I never considered myself as technical skilled pianist, so playing the
Sonata op. 36 b flat minor by Rachmaninoff is a big challenge for me.
I wanted to play this piece since I heard a recording of Horowitz's performance. It's the reason I choose to play "his" version of it,
if I recall correctly, Rachmaninoff heard Horowitz's version and liked it.

I play this Sonata for a half of a year now and I have mostly problems
with the third movement. This movement doesn't fit me, but I still want
to play it to convince myself that I can do it. This part of Sonata I
play for two months, so it's far from what it supposed to be.

I have to be my own teacher, so here are my comments to my recording from today.

I didn't breath - I think it's my major problem in this piece. There are
obvious mistakes, which were caused by mental fatigue - it started in the
second part of it and killed the coda. The tiredness was caused by not
breathing enough - when the phrase doesn't breath, the pianist also doesn't.
I kneaded some phrases, because I couldn't stop myself.

I can't hear the difference between piano and forte in my recording,
it may be caused by quality of camera, but I should pay attention to it in future.

I think the tempo I had chosen was too fast for my knowledge of this piece. I couldn't manage pulse
properly in this tempo, because I couldn't count it.
It may be even the final tempo for me, I think it's fast enough. But
now is not the time for such tempo.

Rubato sections should be more rubato, but with counting, the will be more natural.
I should sing more in these spots.

There is no interpretation in my playing, I just played the notes - I think
it's my second major mistake. Maybe when I interpret this the phrases will become more
understandable and it will be easier to breathe.
Nothing had any meaning, which makes this recording not acceptable.

I recommend myself:
1. Practice slowly.
2. Practice with counting.
3. Play in a medium tempo a whole movement,
don't make mistakes - it's an "exercise" for my mental problems with it.
4. Pay more attention to dynamic marks.
5. Create an interpretation of it, listen to some recordings more.
