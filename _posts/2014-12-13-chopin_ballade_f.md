excerpt: Practice performance no 2 - 12.13.2014

So today I tried to play the Ballade. I felt better than last time, there are spots, 
where I'm sure what I want to say. Unfortunetely the right pedal in my piano started 
to squeak and it was bothering me during my performance (of course this is not 
an explanation of my mistakes). I was struggling with my memory also - recently 
I discovered that the edition I was using is a piece of junk with a lot of mistakes, 
for example changed rhytms, some added or removed ligaturas, etc... So my main goal 
in this week was to fix damage because of this. It's not easy to eradicate this 
kind of mistakes and I wasn't sucessful in this.

Issues:
1. Fix the bars 46-50 - chords in left hand
2. Fix the bar 53 - the chord on the first beat (previous edition mistake)
3. Fix the bars 61-62 - fingering in left hand (previous edition mistake)
4. Fix the passages in 72-76. <b>Solution</b>: don't rush before, in bar 70 there is a ritenuto, in 72 a tempo, but not more. Accelerando is in the second half of bar 74, so don't play faster before. Learn the line of the upper notes in passage better with left hand.
5. Fix the whole section which begins in bar 80, shape a phrase, relearn a notes (previous edition mistake)
6. Fix the left hand in bars 106-107
7. Fix the left hand in bar 119, just count it properly while playing. Also fix the passage in right hand - practice upper notes more.
8. Fix bars 122-124 - just don't crush and don't rush.
9. Fix bar 144 - there is no chords in left hand (previous edition mistake)
10. Fix the start of the passage in bar 162 and 167
11. Fix the lack of pulse in left hand in bars 173-174
12. Figure out why I can't play the polyrhythm in 175 when playing the whole piece
13. Fix the passages section starting in bar 191, there can't be any slip
14. Fix chords in bar 196 and 198-201. <b>Solution</b>: don't rush passages before
and take it easy - I think it's the mental thing. If I rush before there
 is nothing I can to to build a stretto
15. Fix the chords in right hand in bar 219 (previous edition mistake)
16. Fix the section starting from 227 in right hand - better articulation

Details:

1. Do a ritenuto in bar 6, shape the melody more from the beginning
2. Less bass in the not-a-"waltz" section, shape the chords
3. More legato in octave section which begins in bar 38
4. Add proper dynamics to bars 53-56, more time for tenuto
5. Section which begins in bar 58 - more singing in melody, melody more like a phrase, less left hand, show some nuances of the second voice
6. Ritenuto in bar 70
7. Shape melody more in 102-103 and 106-107
8. More majesty in bar 125
9. In theme starting from bar 129 more calm in left hand, adjust the tempo to the beginning of the piece
10. Leggiero section starting from 112 should be lighter, show trill more, let the sixths fly.
11. Bars 137, 141, 144 - the repeated notes should mean something
12. Motives in section beginning in bar 152 should correspond more with each other
13. Shape more the culmination and the final, think more about the pedal
